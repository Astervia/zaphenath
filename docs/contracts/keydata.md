# KeyData Struct

The `KeyData` struct holds the full state of a single key in the Zaphenath contract. It encapsulates all metadata and access configurations for secure storage.

## 📘 Definition

```solidity
struct KeyData {
    address owner;
    bytes data;
    uint256 lastPing;
    uint256 timeout;
    bool readableBeforeTimeout;
    mapping(address => Custodian) custodians;
    bool exists;
}
```

> ℹ️ The `KeyData` struct uses an internal mapping, so it cannot be returned or passed directly in external/public functions.

## 🔐 Fields

| Field                   | Type                            | Description                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `owner`                 | `address`                       | Owner of the key                                          |
| `data`                  | `bytes`                         | Encrypted or opaque data payload                          |
| `lastPing`              | `uint256`                       | Timestamp of last `ping()`                                |
| `timeout`               | `uint256`                       | Number of seconds before data becomes accessible          |
| `readableBeforeTimeout` | `bool`                          | If true, allows the owner to read data before the timeout |
| `custodians`            | `mapping(address => Custodian)` | Role and ping permission map for external users           |
| `exists`                | `bool`                          | Tracks if the key is initialized                          |

## 🧠 Design Considerations

- Uses nested mappings to support per-user access control.
- `readableBeforeTimeout` is enforced only for the **owner**.
- `exists` avoids accidental reads on uninitialized keys.

## 🧪 Testing Tips

- Validate default values upon key creation
- Verify access rules with various custodian combinations
- Ensure timeout enforcement and `ping()` logic are working
