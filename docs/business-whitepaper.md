# üßæ Zaphenath Business White Paper

## What is Zaphenath?

Zaphenath is a smart contract protocol that protects sensitive information until a period of user inactivity has passed. Designed for Ethereum-compatible blockchains, Zaphenath lets users store encrypted data (a "key") and define exactly when and under what conditions it should become accessible to others.

It's a solution built for wills, emergency data access, legal disclosure, and organizational continuity. If the original user becomes inactive‚Äîmeasured by the absence of periodic "pings"‚Äîdata can be automatically released to trusted parties.

## Problem & Opportunity

### ‚ùå Current Systems Fail

- Cloud storage doesn‚Äôt know if the user is alive or not.
- Legal will execution is slow, bureaucratic, and fallible.
- No blockchain-native solution exists to unlock encrypted content conditionally.

### ‚úÖ What Users Need

- A **verifiable liveness protocol**.
- **Fine-grained control** over access and delegation.
- Something simple, secure, and non-custodial.

Zaphenath is the first programmable solution to combine these elements in a decentralized way.

## How It Works

1. The user stores encrypted data in a smart contract key.
2. The user defines a timeout and optional "read before timeout" flag.
3. They assign custodians (trusted people) with roles like Reader, Writer, or Pinger.
4. If the user doesn‚Äôt "ping" within the timeout, the data becomes accessible to Readers.

All logic is on-chain, verifiable, and enforced via Ethereum timestamps.

## Use Cases

| Sector       | Use Case                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Legaltech    | Digital wills, estate planning                 |
| Fintech      | Emergency key custody, account unlock triggers |
| Enterprise   | Internal continuity for founder/keyholder data |
| DAOs         | Governance documents unlock post-inactivity    |
| Education/IP | Delayed release of confidential research       |

## Why Blockchain?

- Guarantees **verifiable time** (via `block.timestamp`)
- Trustless role enforcement and access delegation
- No centralized custodian or backend required

Zaphenath provides the _right to remain private, until proven inactive._

## Market Strategy

- Open-source core, free to use and fork
- Premium consulting for legal, enterprise, and DAO integrations
- Ecosystem grants and governance to be launched in 2026
