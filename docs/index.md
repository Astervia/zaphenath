# Welcome to Zaphenath Documentation

Zaphenath is a smart contract system for storing confidential data that becomes accessible after a period of user inactivity. It is ideal for digital wills, emergency business data access, and contingency disclosures.

This documentation will guide you through everything you need to understand, deploy, and use the Zaphenath contract system.

## 🔐 What is Zaphenath?

Zaphenath allows users to:

- Create encrypted data entries ("keys") that only they can access
- Configure access policies based on inactivity timeouts
- Delegate access and responsibilities to trusted custodians
- Toggle whether the data is readable before the timeout or only after

It uses Solidity, is designed for Ethereum-compatible networks, and is built using the Foundry development stack.
