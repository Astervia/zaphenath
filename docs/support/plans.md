# ðŸ’Ž Support Plans for Zaphenath

> Zaphenath is open-source infrastructure for time-gated access control. We donâ€™t sell software â€” we develop it collaboratively. Your donation keeps updates coming, tests running, and features evolving. In exchange, we unlock tools and consultancy time based on your support tier.

You may also donate outside of fixed plans and still receive thanks and community recognition.
